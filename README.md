# Pokémon Cards App

For all Pokémon fans ✨

This app provides you a cool view of 10 Pokémon cards that you can scroll through. 🍄

Every card contains information about the pokémon's type, level and number. ⚡️

You can search for Pokémon names through the search bar by clicking on the search icon and reset your search by clicking on the Pokémon ball. 🔮

You can also filter the pokémons by their types and sort their number in an ascending and descending order. 🚀

For the data, I have used this public API (https://pokemontcg.io).

🧩 About the features: 

🧩 Search for pokémons: please click on the search icon to see the results

🧩 Sort by types: When you are finished with selecting types, please close the dropdown by clicking on the home bar.
