# Pokémon Cards App

For all Pokémon fans ✨

This app provides you a cool view of 10 Pokémon cards that you can scroll through. 🍄

Every card contains information about the pokémon's type, level and hit points. ⚡️

You can search for Pokémon names through the search bar by clicking on the search icon and reset your search by clicking on the Pokémon ball. 🔮

You can also filter the pokémons by their types and sort the hit points in an ascending and descending order. 🚀

For the data, I have used this public API (https://pokemontcg.io).
