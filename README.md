# Pok√©mon Cards App

For all Pok√©mon fans ‚ú®

This app provides you a cool view of 10 Pok√©mon cards that you can scroll through. üçÑ

Every card contains information about the pok√©mon's type, level and hit points. ‚ö°Ô∏è

You can search for Pok√©mon names through the search bar by clicking on the search icon and reset your search by clicking on the Pok√©mon ball. üîÆ

You can also filter the pok√©mons by their types and sort the hit points in an ascending and descending order. üöÄ

For the data, I have used this public API (https://pokemontcg.io).

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

## 1. Install
